# Update Journal: ubuntu22-upgrade deployment on dvgs-lab3

**Date:** 2026-04-16
**Branch:** feature/ubuntu22-upgrade
**Target:** dvgs-lab3.cttb (current IP: 10.11.30.32, WAN port)

---

## Pre-deployment State

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| OS | Ubuntu 20.04.6 LTS (focal) |
| Kernel | 5.15.0-139-generic |
| Hostname | dvgs-lab3 |
| IP | 10.11.13.78 (wlo1, WiFi, DHCP) |
| Python | 3.13 (discovered by Ansible) |
| Inventory IP | 10.11.9.23 (stale — does not match actual) |

## Events

### 2026-04-16 — Session Start

1. **GRUB issue:** Machine wouldn't show GRUB menu (timeout=0). Had to catch GRUB CLI manually.
2. **Login issue:** Mac-layout Logitech keyboard caused credential entry problems. TTY was also locked out.
3. **Recovery:** Booted via GRUB CLI, set temporary credentials (`administrator:a`).
4. **SSH initially down:** Host was pingable but SSH timed out. Started `openssh-server` from console.
5. **Connectivity confirmed:** SSH and Ansible ping both working.

### Notes

- Host is on WiFi (`wlo1`) not wired Ethernet — inventory `ansible_address` is wrong for current network config.
- Python 3.13 present on a 20.04 system is unexpected; may have been manually added.
- Ansible warns about interpreter discovery — consider setting `ansible_python_interpreter` explicitly.

## Pre-deploy Snapshot

Captured to `/root/pre-deploy-snapshot-20260416-123912` on dvgs-lab3:

```
configs.tar.gz    — /etc/apt, /etc/cups, /etc/ldap, /etc/pam.d, /etc/fstab, /etc/lightdm, /etc/xdg, CA certs
dpkg-selections.txt — full package list (for dpkg --set-selections restore)
services.txt      — running services at snapshot time
ip-addr.txt       — network interface state
netplan.txt       — netplan config
```

Rollback: extract `configs.tar.gz` to `/`, restore packages via `dpkg --set-selections < dpkg-selections.txt && apt-get dselect-upgrade -y`, reboot.

## Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. Inventory group name mismatch (BLOCKER)

**Problem:** `plays/cs-lab-2404.yml` targets `dvgs_cs_lab` but inventory defined `dvgs_cslab` (no underscore between "cs" and "lab"). Same for `dvbs_cslab` and `drbu_cslab`. Ansible silently matched no hosts.

**Fix:** Renamed all three groups in `inventory/hosts_os_upgrade.ini`:
```
[dvgs_cslab]  → [dvgs_cs_lab]
[dvbs_cslab]  → [dvbs_cs_lab]
[drbu_cslab]  → [drbu_cs_lab]
```
Also updated `:vars` sections and `[*_hosts:children]` references.

**Command to verify:** `ansible-inventory --graph | grep cs_lab`

### 2. Duplicate host entries

**Problem:** dvgs-lab1 through dvgs-lab8 were listed twice in the `[dvgs_cs_lab]` group.

**Fix:** Removed the duplicate block (was lines 214-223).

### 3. Deprecated `include:` directive (BLOCKER)

**Problem:** `roles/desktop-20.04/tasks/main.yml` used bare `include:` which was removed in ansible-core post-2023. Ansible 2.20 rejects it outright.

**Fix:** Replaced all 6 occurrences with `include_tasks:`:
```yaml
# Before
- include: lubuntu.yml
# After
- include_tasks: lubuntu.yml
```

Files affected: `lubuntu.yml`, `lang.yml`, `lookandfeel.yml`, `sw.yml`, `sw-goldendict.yml`, `sound.yml`

### 4. group_vars not loaded for playbook runs (BLOCKER)

**Problem:** `group_vars/` at repo root was not found when running playbooks. Ansible resolves `group_vars/` relative to the **inventory file location** (`inventory/hosts_os_upgrade.ini`), so it looked for `inventory/group_vars/` which didn't exist.

Ad-hoc commands (`ansible -m debug`) worked because `ANSIBLE_HOSTS` env var (from `utils/setup-env`) points to `./hosts` at repo root, where `./group_vars/` IS adjacent.

**Fix:** Created symlinks:
```bash
ln -s ../group_vars inventory/group_vars
ln -s ../host_vars inventory/host_vars
```

**How to verify:** `ansible dvgs-lab3.cttb -m debug -a "var=deb_mirror"` should show the resolved value.

### 5. APT mirror unreachable (RESOLVED)

**Problem:** `apt.cttb` refused connections from dvgs-lab3 on WiFi.

**Fix:** Connected device to WAN port (new IP: 10.11.30.32). APT mirror reachable. Updated inventory with `ansible_host=10.11.30.32`.

### 6. Python 3.8 / Ansible 2.20 incompatibility (RESOLVED)

**Problem:** Ansible 2.20 requires Python 3.9+ on targets. Ubuntu 20.04 ships Python 3.8. The `apt` module produced deserialization errors (dual JSON output from 3.8 and 3.13 interpreters).

**Root cause:** `/usr/bin/python3` symlinked to `python3.8`. The `apt` module's bootstrap discovers `/usr/bin/python3` regardless of `ansible_python_interpreter` setting. Also, `python3-apt` bindings (`apt_pkg.so`, `apt_inst.so`) were compiled for cpython-38 only.

**Fixes applied on dvgs-lab3:**
```bash
# Repoint python3 to 3.13
sudo ln -sf python3.13 /usr/bin/python3

# Symlink apt bindings for 3.13
sudo ln -sf apt_pkg.cpython-38-x86_64-linux-gnu.so \
  /usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/apt_pkg.cpython-313-x86_64-linux-gnu.so
sudo ln -sf apt_inst.cpython-38-x86_64-linux-gnu.so \
  /usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/apt_inst.cpython-313-x86_64-linux-gnu.so
```

**Note:** These symlinks are fragile (3.8 ABI loaded by 3.13). This workaround is acceptable for testing but reinforces the decision to do clean PXE reinstalls rather than in-place upgrades.

### 7. Deprecated `warn` parameter in command module (RESOLVED)

**Problem:** `roles/common-20.04/tasks/main.yml` used `warn: false` in `command` module args. The `warn` parameter was removed in ansible-core 2.20+.

**Fix:** Removed `args: warn: false` from both `apt autoremove` tasks (lines 278-279, 294-295).

### 8. `ubuntu-desktop-minimal` package not available on 20.04

**Problem:** `roles/desktop-20.04/tasks/lubuntu.yml` references `ubuntu-desktop-minimal` which is a 22.04+ package.

**Resolution:** Not a bug — the `cs-lab-2404.yml` playbook is designed for post-PXE-install configuration on 24.04, not for running on 20.04 hosts. Decision made to use PXE reinstall path instead of in-place upgrade.

## Dry Run Results (cs-lab-2404.yml against 20.04 host)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Tasks passed | 31 |
| Tasks failed | 1 (ubuntu-desktop-minimal — expected, 24.04 package) |
| Tasks skipped | 16 |
| Changed | 1 (apt cache refresh) |

All infrastructure/config tasks pass. Package installation tasks expect 24.04. This confirms the playbook is ready for post-PXE-install use.

## Decision: PXE Reinstall over In-Place Upgrade

**Date:** 2026-04-16

In-place dist-upgrade (20.04 → 22.04 → 24.04) was considered but rejected:
- Requires two version hops (can't skip)
- `do-release-upgrade` is fragile over SSH, often needs interactive prompts
- Python 3.8 / Ansible 2.20 incompatibility makes automation unreliable on 20.04
- Leaves package cruft and broken configs

**Chosen path:** PXE reinstall to Ubuntu 24.04 via the `netinstall-2404` role, then configure with `cs-lab-2404.yml`.

### PXE Pipeline Assessment

The `netinstall-2404` role was reviewed. The pipeline is **fully autonomous** — no interactive gates:
- `autoinstall` + `noprompt` kernel params
- `PROMPT 0` in PXE menu (auto-boots, 10s timeout to local disk)
- Pre-set admin password hash, SSH key injection via late-commands
- Post-install script is non-interactive

### RISK: Storage layout is destructive

All autoinstall profiles use `storage: layout: name: direct` which **wipes the entire disk**. Lab machines (including dvgs-lab3) have Windows partitions (OS, WINRETOOLS, DELLSUPPORT, Image recovery) that will be destroyed.

**Decision:** Risk accepted. Lab machines are Ubuntu-primary; Windows partitions are legacy OEM installs not in active use. Dell recovery can be rebuilt from Dell media if ever needed.

## Next Steps: PXE Pipeline

1. Set up PXE server — `ansible-playbook plays/netinstall-2404.yml`
2. Test on dvgs-lab3 — WoL, PXE boot, autoinstall
3. Post-install config — `ansible-playbook plays/cs-lab-2404.yml --limit dvgs-lab3.cttb`
4. Verify services (CUPS, LDAP, NFS, CA certs, desktop)
5. Roll out to remaining dvgs_cs_lab hosts

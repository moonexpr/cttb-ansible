## Events

### 2026-04-16 — Session Start

1. **GRUB issue:** Machine wouldn't show GRUB menu (timeout=0). Had to catch GRUB CLI manually.
2. **Login issue:** Mac-layout Logitech keyboard caused credential entry problems. TTY was also locked out.
3. **Recovery:** Booted via GRUB CLI, set temporary credentials (`administrator:a`).
4. **SSH initially down:** Host was pingable but SSH timed out. Started `openssh-server` from console.
5. **Connectivity confirmed:** SSH and Ansible ping both working.

### Notes

- Host is on WiFi (`wlo1`) not wired Ethernet — inventory `ansible_address` is wrong for current network config.
- Python 3.13 present on a 20.04 system is unexpected; may have been manually added.
- Ansible warns about interpreter discovery — consider setting `ansible_python_interpreter` explicitly.
